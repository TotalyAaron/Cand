0.0.3: [

Bug fixes:
- Fixed the bug where after compiling a program, you cannot compile another one unless you rerun the application.

New features:

- Added array support. {
  "let int8** some_strings = int8*[2]" for declaring an array of ASCII strings
  Note: You cannot instantly declare an array with "int8*[2]{...}" yet, it'll be a feature in newer versions.
 }

- Added array indexing support. {
  "ret some_strings[1]" to return the second element in the array "some_strings". Indexing goes like: "[0]" for 1st element, "[1]" for 2nd element, etc.
}

- Added setting variables. {
  "some_strings[1] = "this is a string"" to set an element (specifically [1] for the 2nd element) to the value "this is a string".
}

Convenience features:
- Added terminal-line support, can now run commands directly with arguments passed into the executable: "candc ...<args>..."
